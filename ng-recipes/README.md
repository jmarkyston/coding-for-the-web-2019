This is the codebase for the "Coding for the Web" 2019 Meetup group.

To initialize the Angular project for the first time, make sure to do the following:

1. Install Node.JS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install Angular CLI globally: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. Install dependencies in the project root: `npm install`
4. Make sure the project builds: `ng build`

To serve the project, run `ng serve`. Optionally, add `--open` to the command to open the project in the browser. By default, this is served at localhost:4200.
